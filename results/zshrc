# Key Bindings

#   On the Mac, open up the Terminal preferences, under your =Basic=
#   settings, select the =Keyboard= tab and select the checkbox for
#   =Use option as meta key= to take avantage of these.

bindkey -e

# =Meta-u= to chdir to the parent directory and then display the contents.

bindkey -s '\eu' '^Ucd ..; ls^M'

# Since =AUTO_PUSHD= is set, =Meta-p= pops the dir stack

bindkey -s '\ep' '^Upopd >/dev/null; dirs -v^M'

# Pipe the current command through less with =Meta-l=

bindkey -s "\el" " 2>&1|less^M"

# Completion

#   I still wonder how important it is to start up the =compinstall=,
#   and auto load the =compinit=. I suppose it wouldn't hurt, eh?

zstyle :compinstall filename '/Users/howard.abrams/.zshrc'

# Add my own custom completion scripts:

fpath=(~/.zsh/completion /usr/local/share/zsh-completions $fpath)

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

# Show completion menu when number of options is at least 2

zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=2
zstyle ":completion:*:descriptions" format "%B%d%b"

# Only do completion for Git, as we don't use any other version
#   control system anymore.

zstyle ":vcs_info:*" enable git  # svn

# Modules

#   Using the modules from [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][Oh My Zsh]]. 
#   The plugins are in =~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*=

plugins=(osx terminalapp gnu-utils lein npm)

# I use [[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/][Homebrew]] on my home computers, but [[http://www.macports.org][MacPorts]] at work.
#   We will check to see which is installed, and then add that
#   completion module:

if [[ -d /usr/local/Cellar ]]
then
    plugins+=(brew)      # Adds a "brews" command
else
    plugins+=(macports)  # Adds "psu" for port self_update and others
fi

# Oh My Zsh

#   Load up the modules and other goodies from Oh my Zsh.

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# My Functions

#   Each machine I'm on (work or home), may have some special functions
#   or aliases, so let's load anything that begins with =.zshrc-=:

if [[ -f $HOME/.zshrc-* ]]
then
    for SH_FILE in $HOME/.zshrc-*
    do
        source $SH_FILE
    done
fi
